## About

**BetterDisplay** is a truly wonderful tool! It lets you convert your displays to **fully scalable screens**, manage **display configuration overrides**, allows **brightness and color control**, provides **XDR/HDR brightness upscaling** (extra brightness beyond 100% for compatible displays with Apple Silicon Macs), **full dimming** to black, helps you **create and manage virtual screens** for your Mac, create **Picture in Picture** windows of your displays and gives you a host of other features to **manage your display's settings** easily from the menu bar. It can even **disconnect/reconnect displays** on-the-fly!

<i>Please note that this comparison is only meant to give you a big picture, does not contain all secondary and derived functionalities (free or paid) for each software, may not be up-to-date and may not be a fair representation in every respect as I am not an expert on the alternative apps. I am pretty sure the devs of respective alternatives would feel the comparison is skewed in some way or I did miss an important aspect or unique advantage of the competing solution. For an educated decision you might want to try all apps that offer some sort of trial. If you feel the comparison is not fair, drop me a note at the [BetterDisplay Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp)!</i>

## Compatibility

- The current v2.x version of the app is compatible with all **Apple Silicon** and **Intel** Macs running macOS **Sonoma** (beta), **Ventura** and **Monterey** (macOS 12.4 and up, latest recommended).
- The current v1.x app version is compatible with macOS **Ventura**, **Monterey**, **Big Sur**, **Catalina** and **Mojave**.
- BetterDisplay license codes work both for the v2.x and v1.x app versions.
- XDR/HDR upscaling requires an Apple XDR display (built-in or external) or a natively connected HDR display (VESA DisplayHDR 600 or higher recommended) and an Apple Silicon Mac.
- The display connect/disconnect feature requires an Apple Silicon Mac running at least macOS Ventura or Intel (all macOS versions supported - on Intel the feature is considered experimental and does cause issues on some configurations). External display sleep/suspend on disconnect is available only on Apple Silicon (on Intel, dimming or DDC backlight off is available for third party displays and backlight off for Apple and built-in displays).
- Native smooth scaling requires macOS Monterey 12.4 (or newer) and natively connected displays on Apple Silicon. For Intel there is no such limitation.
- Maximum native smooth scaling resolutions depend on the GPU capabilities and the display's resolution (horizontal width limit is 6144 pixels for M1/M2, 7680 pixels for M1/M2 Pro/Max/Ultra).
- External display hardware backlight control and volume control require DDC capable, natively connected display or an Apple display. Some docks and dongles may not support DDC. All built-in ports of all Macs that can run the app are supported for DDC communication. 
- The app is compatible with headless Macs to create custom virtual screen (dummy) resolutions for remote access.
